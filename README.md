Labs-Java
===========

I use this repository to refresh some Java programming and to remember how to do things in Java.
If you want to learn, I honestly recommend you a good text editor and the command line. Here it's just
"plain java" - no libs, frameworks, etc, just quick examples. That's it!

Feel free to fork it.
